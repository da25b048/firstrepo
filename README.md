My first repo

My name is Soham.
I live in Pune.
I like to play chess, cards, mafia, table tennis, and badminton. 
I like to walk by nature trail, yoga, pranayam and meditation. 
I like to explore applications of mathematics in various fields. I have participated in an Imotc camp.
I like to do programming. I have cleared Zonal Informatics Olympiad and Zonal Computing Olympiad.

I like Git because it provides storage method and it maintains history of changes done.

I liked the problem in which we had to find the first non-repeating character in a string because I found multiple ways to solve it: O(n**2), O(nlogn), O(n).
